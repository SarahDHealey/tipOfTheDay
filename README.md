# react_native_api_hit
Your app needs to display the image that comes from the tip api.
Hint :  USE THE DOCS !!!!!  Read the React Native docs for how to implement Images.
2nd hint:  your image is delivered to you in http:// format.  However, this app is configured so that only https:// images can be displayed.  
Calling https:// on the image provided by the api WILL WORK. But you need to change the URL so that is uses https:// and not http://  . You cannot change the api itself, I own that.
